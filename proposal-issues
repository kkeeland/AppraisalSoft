Items listed that are pre-baked into Meteor

Multi-Tenancy vs. Unique Databases 
    Running multiple offices under this software requires a major decision to be made about Database structure:

            Single Database per Office 
                    Pros: Scale as needed per office growth, issues are isolate
                    Cons: Updates require updating ALL offices databases individually (WAY MORE COST), Each database requires maintence individually, 
                            each time there is a new office it would require building a new DB each time. 
            Multiple offices on one sharded database 
                    Pros: It can be scaled up by adding more databases that are replications of the first, low cost to maintain, low cost to upgrade, 
                    low cost in general. 
                    Cons: Cant easily put offices on their own DB if they grow faster than other offices, all offices are forced to use the same technology (not a huge issue)
